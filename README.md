This is my completed Slope project with all the code and 3d models. 
Supproting files such as package files, the Unity library files and other default files that came from Unity have not been included for succinctness. Therefore, the viewer will not be able to directly transfer the project into Unity, however all assets created by me have been included. 
Code can be found under the Scripts file. (The code was written in c# and the code files are .cs. The .meta code files are automatically created by Unity.)
3D-models are under the Prefabs file. 
Materials are under the Materials file.
